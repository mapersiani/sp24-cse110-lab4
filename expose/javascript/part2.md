12. Object
    A. student.name; \
    B. student['Grad Year']; \
    C. student.greeting(); \
    D. student['Favorite Teacher'].name; \
    E. student.courseLoad[0];
13. Arithmetic \
    A. '32': The + operator, when used with a string and a number, converts the number to a string and performs string concatenation.\
    B. 1: The - operator converts both operands to numbers (if possible) and performs arithmetic subtraction. \
    C. 3: null is converted to 0 when used with the + operator in an arithmetic operation. \
    D. '3null': null is treated as a string and concatenated with '3'. \
    E. 4: In arithmetic operations, true is converted to 1.\
    F. 0: Both false and null are converted to 0 in arithmetic operations. \
    G. '3undefined': When used with the + operator, undefined is converted to the string 'undefined', resulting in concatenation. \
    H. NaN: undefined cannot be converted to a number, so the result of this arithmetic operation is Not-a-Number.
14. Comparison \
    A. true: The string '2' is converted to the number 2 before the comparison, and 2 is greater than 1. \
    B. false: When comparing strings, character by character comparison is performed, and '2' is lexicographically higher than '1'. \
    C. true: The == operator performs type coercion and converts the string '2' to the number 2 before the comparison. \
    D. false: The === operator does not perform type coercion and strictly compares both value and type, so a number does not equal a string. \
    E. false: true is converted to 1 during type coercion, and 1 is not equal to 2. \
    F. true: Boolean(2) returns true, and since both operands are of the same type (boolean), the strict equality operator returns true.
15. The == operator performs type coercion if the two operands are not of the same type; for example, it will convert a string to a number before comparing. On the other hand, the === operator does not do type coercion and requires both the value and type to be the same for it to return true.

17. The function returns [2, 4, 6]. 
    1.  i = 0: doSomething(1) returns 2, and newArr becomes [2]. 
    2.  i = 1: doSomething(2) returns 4, and newArr becomes [2, 4].
    3.  i = 2: doSomething(3) returns 6, and newArr becomes [2, 4, 6].
